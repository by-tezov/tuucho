# Color Definition

The `color` object is used to define multi-context color values. It supports both direct definitions and references, allowing for consistent theming and reusability across screens or subs.

## 1. Full Object Format

- `id` follows the same rules outlined in [ID Definition](id.md), meaning it can be either a unique definition, a pointer, or a combination.
- `default`: defines the fallback or main color value (**required**)
- Additional keys (e.g., `dark`, `light`, or any custom theme/context code) define alternative color values for different contexts or themes

Example:

```json
"key-color": {
  "id": "primary-color",
  "default": "#007bff",
  "dark": "#0056b3",
  "light": "#66b2ff"
}
```

This format ensures the application can render colors based on the active theme or context. If no value is found for the current context, the `default` value is used.

- `key-color` depends on the components. Check the component definition.

## 2. String Format (Short Syntax)

You can simplify the declaration by using a single string for the default color:

```json
"key-color": "#007bff"
```

This is equivalent to:

```json
"key-color": {
  "default": "#007bff"
}
```

This format is useful when youâ€™re not using multiple themes or want to quickly define a static color.

## 3. Pointer Reference (Short Syntax)

Instead of defining color directly, you can reference a color defined elsewhere (in the same page or in Subs) by prefixing the value with `*`.

Example:

```json
"key-color": "*shared-primary-color"
```

Equivalent to:

```json
"key-color": {
  "id": "*shared-primary-color"
}
```

The engine will resolve the pointer by searching first in the local page, then in the shared Subs.

This approach helps maintain consistent colors across pages and reduces duplication.

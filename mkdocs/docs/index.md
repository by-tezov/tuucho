# TUUCHO - à¸•à¸¹à¹‰à¹‚à¸Šà¸§à¹Œ - Rendering Engine

> **Documentation in Progress** â€” Early stage of development


## Overview

TUUCHO is a dynamic UI rendering engine driven by JSON-based layouts. It interprets a flexible JSON structure describing the entire UI, behaviors and renders the application interface accordingly.

ðŸš€ **It is available on Android and iOS thanks to Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM).**

Key features include:

- Definable components with unique IDs allowing shared references to reduce JSON payload size. This applies to content, styles, text, and more.
- Intelligent caching: JSON objects are cached locally to minimize repeated network requests. Content is fetched over the network only when necessary.

### Supported Components

- **Linear Layout** (vertical or horizontal orientation)
- **Button** with built-in actions:
    - Navigation
    - Form submission
- **Label**
- **Input Field** (form element)
- **Spacer**

For detailed future plans and roadmap, see [Roadmap](roadmap.md).

## Processing Workflow

1. **Configuration Fetching**  
   The application starts by downloading a JSON configuration file containing a list of URLs and version information.

2. **Content Retrieval**  
   Each URL in the configuration is checked against the local cache. If missing, the corresponding JSON content is fetched from the network.

3. **Rectification**  
   Retrieved JSON data passes through the **Rectifier**, a process that validates and adjusts the JSON structure for compatibility with the rendering engine.

4. **Breaking Down**  
   The rectified JSON is fragmented into smaller components by the **Breaker** process. These components are then stored in the local database.

5. **Home Screen Initialization**  
   When displaying a screen (e.g., `FooScreen`):
   - If components for `FooScreen` exist in the database, they are retrieved.
     - The **Assembler** reconstructs the full JSON page from these components, including only what is necessary.
     - The final JSON is passed to the **Renderer** which draws the UI.
   - If components for `FooScreen` doesn't exist in the database, they are fetched, saved in database. Then the rendering process is done.

6. **Dynamic content**
   - If the `FooScreen` contains some context data (user context data that can't be cached), it is retrieved in the background and the FooScreen is updated on the fly.

  G --> H[Application want show 'FooScreen' URL]

  H1 -- Yes --> I[(Retrieve parts from DB)]
  I --> J[Assembler: Rebuild Page]

```

## Json File Structure

```json
{
  "version": "",
  "root": { /* component */ },
  "components": [ /* component */ ],
  "styles": [ /* style */ ],
  "contents": [ /* content */ ],
  "texts": [ /* text */ ],
  "colors": [ /* color */ ],
  "dimensions": [ /* dimension */ ]
}
```

Each **PAGE** and **TEMPLATE** **must** include a `root` key, which defines the top-level component of the screen. Other keys such as `components`, `contents`, `styles`, `texts`, `colors`, and `dimensions` are optional. Note that the `root` key is **not** required inside **SUBS**.

- **PAGE** represents a full-screen rendered component.
- **TEMPLATE** represents a full-screen rendered component with not content. They can be used multiple times with different contents
- **SUBS** are shared objects that can be referenced by their ID, which always starts with `*`.

Any ID starting with `*` is treated as a reference. When the parser encounters such a reference, it first searches within the current PAGE; if not found, it then looks inside the SUBS.

## More about SUBS

**Subs** are shared libraries loaded by the application before rendering any page.

- They enable sharing of common components, styles, texts, and other assets across multiple pages.
- References to shared objects use the `*` prefix notation.
- Shared components can be either global or local to a page. If the parser does not find a reference locally, it will look for it in the shared library.

Many self-explanatory examples are provided throughout this documentation. To make the best use of **Subs**, it is important to understand how to assign IDs to your elements. For more details, please refer to the [ID page](object-definition/id.md).

## More about Dynamic Context Data Updates

In certain cases, components on a page depend on dynamic data that is not included in the local page definition or cached globally in SUBS. When such components are encountered during the assembly phase, the system handles them intelligently to maintain a smooth user experience.

### How It Works

When the **Assembler** encounters a component with a reference to an object that is **not locally or globally available**, such as:

```json
{
  "id": {
    "value": "hobbies",
    "source": "*input-field-on-demand"
  },
  "subset": "field"
}
```

it recognizes that additional data is required to fully render the component.

### Background Fetch Process

1. The Assembler gathers all **missing objects** (e.g., components, contents, texts) required to render the page properly.
2. It initiates a background request to the corresponding dynamic URL: {current-page}-on-demand-definition. This URL is expected to return all the necessary missing elements.
3. Once the data is received:
    - The **Shadower** step dynamically injects the new objects into the existing view structure.
    - The affected UI sections are updated **in place**, without requiring a full reload.

### Placeholder Rendering

While waiting for the missing data, the renderer shows **placeholder UI elements** (aka **skimmers**) in place of the missing content. These serve as visual indicators to users that the data is being loaded.

This ensures:
- Fast initial rendering of all available UI.
- Smooth transition as dynamic data becomes available.
- Flexible modular content delivery that doesnâ€™t block page rendering due to partial data.

## ðŸš§ Current Focus

Work in progress:

- **Cache Management Enhancements**
  - Add TTL (time-to-live) options to avoid indefinite cache persistence.
  - Implement versioning and automatic cache purging for consistency and efficiency.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Medium-Term Goals

- **Configuration File Support**  
  Complete support for configuration files to allow application-wide settings.

- **Real time Data Support**  
  Introduce dynamic data binding to enable real-time content updates within the UI.

- **Advanced UI Components**  
  Add comprehensive, fully tested UI components to cover a wider range of application needs.

- **Action, Validator, Navigation, other useful solvable by pointer**  

- **Module Exception instead of all at Default**

---

## ðŸš€ Long-Term Vision

- **Behavior & Animation System**  
  Implement an extensible behavior module to handle animations and interactive UI elements.

- **Modular UI Components**  
  Support UI components as independent modules for easier customization and extensibility.

- **Accessibility Enhancements**  
  Improve accessibility features to meet modern standards and ensure inclusivity.

- **Improved JSON Parsing Feedback**  
  Provide detailed, user-friendly warnings and errors to simplify troubleshooting of JSON input.

- **Parser Efficiency Optimizations**  
  Explore cache indexing, metadata, or other innovative techniques to accelerate JSON parsing and rendering.

- **Unit Tests + E2E Tests**  
  Before production validation to protect from any regression.

- **Documentation**  
  Add developer documentation for creating user modules and custom components.

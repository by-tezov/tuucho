# Tuucho Documentation

Tuucho provides several extension points to customize application behavior:

- **Monitors**
- **Interceptors**
- **Middleware**
- **ActionMiddleware**
- **Custom view, Custom parser extension**

It also includes many **built-in features**, while still allowing you to add your own logic at every critical layer of the engine.

# Integration

To get started, refer to the quick start guide: [quick-start.md](quick-start.md)

The [tuucho‑sample](https://github.com/by-tezov/tuucho) is also extremely valuable: it contains ready-to-use code demonstrating navigation, actions, middleware, monitors, configuration, use cases, and more.

# Note

Tuucho is still actively in development. The next focus will be to **add coil to allow images**:

A lot of work has already been done, and if you've been following the project since the beginning, you can now start to see what Tuucho is becoming.

More features, stability improvements, and documentation updates are coming soon.

Tuucho is evolving fast — and you're early enough to watch it take shape.

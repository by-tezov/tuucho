## In progress


- TTL
  - look the validity validityDateTime on refresh cache and retrieve
  - then think how I can do for on demand definition


**** ****
 - add language management
- add selector management + on text language too (not only dimension/color)
- add bottom/top screen not react to transition
- Improve: update view have a knowledge of previous element and next element to avoid overhear job (aka generate validators)
- Improve: add option wait all available before to render the view instead of render on the fly
- Improve: solution for JsonObject low storage update easy ?
- rectifier after array, never return null and so over work on replace maybe not needed
- add config to remove hard string inside di
- When do the ttl stuff, improve the database code. Not readable, not scalable, not maintainable... fix the cancel bug stuff
- Check the TODO List
- Fix unique constraint failed be cause job not cancelled when navigated faster than the on demand data arrive.

## In progress

- on network error hook -> cf credential not valid, need to redirect

- why remember need to be duplicated on Barrel while interface and class not

- do the rectifier actions + resolve
- do rectifier on response form received
- state initial value parser rectifier not done
- add API validator

-update doc and close the release

- still need to fix mock server

**** ****
- add lock on command (mke it smart and easy for nested lock... and always released, cf throw on network)
- add language management
- add selector management + on text language too (not only dimension/color)
- add bottom/top screen not react to transition


- Improve: update view have a knowledge of previous element and next element to avoid overhear job (aka generate validators)
- Improve: solution for JsonObject low storage update easy ?
- rectifier after array, never return null and so over work on replace maybe not needed


- use builtType to create variant (Production, Stage, Dev, Mock) instead of Release/Debug + Flavor catalog

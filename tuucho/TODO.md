### Todo:

- contextual update ??? does it react to language ?

- Shadower catch network error ? -> sample application strategy ?
- NavigationRepositoryProtocol.MaterialCache -> better than class, useless to build
  an object with lot al suspendlazy class when not all are used...
- screen context better way to use it ?
- projection input dataclass ?
- Image language too

- Doc image action
- Doc action language
    
- Animation placeholder / final image ?

- do a smart padding object - can do also for size)?
- shadower with flow ?
- error message with class name that throw.

--> Continue to follow the Roadmap

### Need to fix: 
- redraw trigger is not convenient, maybe add a general purpose event state where view could register to it ?
- contextual register, when outer receive later, the inner did not succeed to register
  - check message of contextual field, they never request update view after click
- Mokkery

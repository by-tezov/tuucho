- projection input dataclass ?

- Doc Http interceptor renamed to middleware exchange
- Doc image action
- Doc action language

### Need to fix: 
- redraw trigger is not convenient, maybe add a general purpose event state where view could register to it ?
- contextual register, when outer receive later, the inner did not succeed to register
  - check message of contextual field, they never request update view after click

## In progress

- Backhandler deprecated TODO
- update doc

### Need to fix: 

- redraw trigger is not convenient, maybe add a general purpose event state where view could register to it ?
- contextual register, when outer receive later, the inner did not succeed to register
  - check message of contextual field, they never request update view after click

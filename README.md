TUUCHO is a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile (KMM) project with most of its code shared across platforms, enabling native iOS and Android support from a single Kotlin codebase. It follows Clean Architecture principles wherever they best fit the project structure, ensuring modularity, testability, and maintainability.

TUUCHO is a powerful and flexible application rendering engine that dynamically generates user interfaces by parsing JSON descriptions. It enables developers to declaratively define app layouts and UI components in a structured JSON format, which TUUCHO then renders seamlessly across platforms.
